# SkyWayJS

## Setting up

Use `npm install` to set up dependencies.

Use `gulp lint` to run eslint.

Use `gulp test` to run unit tests.

Use `gulp build` to build the library (babelify, browserify, uglify).


## Contributing

Make sure you have nodejs installed. Run `npm install` to get started. After making changes in `src/`, you run `gulp test` to run tests and then the `gulp` command to validate and build skyway.js!
